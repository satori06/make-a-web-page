 Navigating and Viewing The Internet

  <p>
  Understanding that the internet is really a web of computers interacting with each other thru commands and computer language. Anytime a person wants to "<em>go somewhere</em>" on the internet they have to type in an address on their browser like www. udacity.com and the computer sends a HTTP Request to a server. <a href="https://www.udacity.com"> Udacity </a> is where you end up. The server finds the appropriate HTML document and sends it back to the user's computer where a web browser interprets the page and displays it on the user's screen.

HTML

  <div class="concept-description">
<p>
  HTML stands for <em><b>Hypertext Markup Language.</em></b> HTML documents make up most of what we see on the internet. It is written in the form of HTML elements consisting of tags enclosed in angle brackets. Here is an example <img s

Tags and Elements
    </div>
<p>
  HTML documents are made of HTML elements. When writing HTML, we tell browsers the type of each element by using HTML tags. < br > is an empty element without a closing tag.

 Inline vs Block Elements
   </div>
  <div class="concept-description">
   <p>
   HTML elements are either <span class="bold">inline</span> or  <span class="bold">block</span>. Block elements form an "invisible box" around the content inside of them. Some examples of inline elements are : a, span, br, img, and strong. Some box elements are: p, div, and form.

      The "tree-like structure" of HTML
    </div>
    </p>
    <p>
      When programmers talk about the "DOM" (Document Object Model) they are talking about the tree-like structure of a page. The "tree-like structure" comes from the fact that HTML elements can have other elements inside of them. You can draw this relationship like a family tree. My mother had multiple children. So did her mother, and so on... 
    </p>
    <p> 
      In a browser, this structure shows up as a series of nested boxes. There are boxes inside of boxes inside of boxes, and so on...

          The relationship between indented HTML and boxes
    </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
    When you read an HTML document as 
          <span class="italic">text</span>, you see a wave of 
          changing indentations going up and down the left side 
          of the document. The more indented an element is, the 
          more deeply nested its corresponding "box" is.

      Text Editors (for programming)
    </div>
    <div class="concept-description">
When writing code, programmers use special text editors (like Sublime Text for example). These editors make the programmer's life easier. For example, some text editors will automatically generate a closing HTML tag when you write an opening tag. Like <em>sractchpad.ios</em> editor.
